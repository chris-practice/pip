Place all site specific modules in the directories below. Unless you have support team approval platform modules should not be placed in the site project repository.

The following structure must be followed:

## contrib/
All contributed modules should be placed in this directory.  If you patch a contrib module you *must* create a PATCHES.txt file in that module's directory which documents the patch and add a copy of the patch to a patches/ directory inside the module directory.

## custom/
Any modules created for this project must be placed in this directory.

## updated/
Do not place modules in this directory.  The updated directory is deprecated.
